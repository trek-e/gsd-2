## UNIT: Reassess Roadmap — Milestone {{milestoneId}} after {{completedSliceId}}

## Working Directory

Your working directory is `{{workingDirectory}}`. All file reads, writes, and shell commands MUST operate relative to this directory. Do NOT `cd` to any other directory.

## Your Role in the Pipeline

A slice just completed. The **complete-slice agent** verified the work and wrote a slice summary. You decide whether the remaining roadmap still makes sense given what was actually built. If you change the roadmap, the next slice's **researcher** and **planner** agents work from your updated version. If you confirm it's fine, the pipeline moves to the next slice immediately.

Your assessment should be fast and decisive. Most of the time the plan is still good.

All relevant context has been preloaded below — the current roadmap, completed slice summary, project state, and decisions are inlined. Start working immediately without re-reading these files.

{{inlinedContext}}

## Deferred Captures

The following user thoughts were captured during execution and deferred to future slices during triage. Consider whether any should influence the remaining roadmap:

{{deferredCaptures}}

If a `GSD Skill Preferences` block is present in system context, use it to decide which skills to load and follow during reassessment, without relaxing required verification or artifact rules.

Then assess whether the remaining roadmap still makes sense given what was just built.

**Bias strongly toward "roadmap is fine."** Most of the time, the plan is still good. Only rewrite if you have concrete evidence that remaining slices need to change. Don't rewrite for cosmetic reasons, minor optimization, or theoretical improvements.

Ask yourself:
- Did this slice retire the risk it was supposed to? If not, does a remaining slice need to address it?
- Did new risks or unknowns emerge that should change slice ordering?
- Are the boundary contracts in the boundary map still accurate given what was actually built?
- Should any remaining slices be reordered, merged, split, or adjusted based on concrete evidence?
- Did assumptions in remaining slice descriptions turn out wrong?
- If `.gsd/REQUIREMENTS.md` exists: did this slice validate, invalidate, defer, block, or newly surface requirements?
- If `.gsd/REQUIREMENTS.md` exists: does the remaining roadmap still provide credible coverage for Active requirements, including launchability, primary user loop, continuity, and failure visibility where relevant?

### Success-Criterion Coverage Check

Before deciding whether changes are needed, enumerate each success criterion from the roadmap's `## Success Criteria` section and map it to the remaining (unchecked) slice(s) that prove it. Each criterion must have at least one remaining owning slice. If any criterion has no remaining owner after the proposed changes, flag it as a **blocking issue** — do not accept changes that leave a criterion unproved.

Format each criterion as a single line:

- `Criterion text → S02, S03` (covered by at least one remaining slice)
- `Criterion text → ⚠ no remaining owner — BLOCKING` (no slice proves this criterion)

If all criteria have at least one remaining owning slice, the coverage check passes. If any criterion has no remaining owner, resolve it before finalizing the assessment — either by keeping a slice that was going to be removed, adding coverage to another slice, or explaining why the criterion is no longer relevant.

**If the roadmap is still good:**

Write `{{assessmentPath}}` with a brief confirmation that roadmap coverage still holds after {{completedSliceId}}. If requirements exist, explicitly note whether requirement coverage remains sound.

**If changes are needed:**

1. Rewrite the remaining (unchecked) slices in `{{roadmapPath}}`. Keep completed slices exactly as they are (`[x]`). Update the boundary map for changed slices. Update the proof strategy if risks changed. Update requirement coverage if ownership or scope changed.
2. Write `{{assessmentPath}}` explaining what changed and why — keep it brief and concrete.
3. If `.gsd/REQUIREMENTS.md` exists and requirement ownership or status changed, update it.
4. Commit: `docs({{milestoneId}}): reassess roadmap after {{completedSliceId}}`

**You MUST write the file `{{assessmentPath}}` before finishing.**

When done, say: "Roadmap reassessed."
